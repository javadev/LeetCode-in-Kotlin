662\. Maximum Width of Binary Tree

Medium

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the **maximum width** of the given tree_.

The **maximum width** of a tree is the maximum **width** among all levels.

The **width** of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is **guaranteed** that the answer will in the range of a **32-bit** signed integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,3,2,5]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3000]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
