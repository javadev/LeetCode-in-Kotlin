3099\. Harshad Number

Easy

An integer divisible by the **sum** of its digits is said to be a **Harshad** number. You are given an integer `x`. Return _the sum of the digits_ of `x` if `x` is a **Harshad** number, otherwise, return `-1`_._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 18

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

The sum of digits of `x` is `9`. `18` is divisible by `9`. So `18` is a Harshad number and the answer is `9`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 23

**Output:** \-1

**Explanation:**

The sum of digits of `x` is `5`. `23` is not divisible by `5`. So `23` is not a Harshad number and the answer is `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 100`
