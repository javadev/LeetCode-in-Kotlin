3005\. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency

Easy

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

Return _the **total frequencies** of elements in_ `nums` _such that those elements all have the **maximum** frequency_.

The **frequency** of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array. So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum. So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
