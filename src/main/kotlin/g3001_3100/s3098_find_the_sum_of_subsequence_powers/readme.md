3098\. Find the Sum of Subsequence Powers

Hard

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and a **positive** integer `k`.

The **power** of a subsequence is defined as the **minimum** absolute difference between **any** two elements in the subsequence.

Return _the **sum** of **powers** of **all** subsequences of_ `nums` _which have length_ **_equal to_** `k`.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

There are 4 subsequences in `nums` which have length 3: `[1,2,3]`, `[1,3,4]`, `[1,2,4]`, and `[2,3,4]`. The sum of powers is `|2 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |2 - 1| + |3 - 4| = 4`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2], k = 2

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The only subsequence in `nums` which has length 2 is `[2,2]`. The sum of powers is `|2 - 2| = 0`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,3,-1], k = 2

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

There are 3 subsequences in `nums` which have length 2: `[4,3]`, `[4,-1]`, and `[3,-1]`. The sum of powers is `|4 - 3| + |4 - (-1)| + |3 - (-1)| = 10`.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n == nums.length <= 50`
*   <code>-10<sup>8</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>8</sup></code>
*   `2 <= k <= n`
